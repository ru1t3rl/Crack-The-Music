# Crack-The-Music
You are a musician locked in a (music) world. To get out you will have to create multiple melody's/rythms. Before you can create the melody's, you will have to find instruments. Each section of the game contains different instrument to create new melody’s (each section is a different music genre). After you complete all sections you can combine all your instruments to create a final melody and escape the world.
(The music isn’t preprogrammed, only the single notes are in the game. A section will only unlock once you have used all instruments).
